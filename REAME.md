# Testing project to handle conflicts in GitHub

- First, I created a new GitHub repository
- Second, I created a logcal folder.
- I initialized git on the local folder.
  - `git init`
- Next, I created a README file.
- I added and committed changes.
  `git add .`
- Finally, I conneted the local repository to the remote repository
  `git remote add origin https://github.com/G-Uzoh/Testing.git`

FOXES FOREVER!
